# Selection and Manipulation of DOM Elements

In this project, you will demonstrate your ability to select specific DOM
elements using a variety of strategies, and then manipulate those elements in a
variety of ways.

## Setup

Clone the starter project from the green button below. Run `npm install` to
install all of the dependencies needed for the project. Open the **index.html**
file in your browser to view your work. You can run the cypress tests with the command `npm test`.

## The tasks

You are provided with an **index.html** file and a **site.css** file. Do not
modify any of the code in these files, or you will fail the tests. You may only
work in the **your-code.js** file.

Open the **your-code.js** file in VSCode. You will complete eight selection and
manipulation tasks which are listed in that file. For each task, you are given
instructions to select a given element, and then manipulate it in a specific
way.

When you refresh the **index.html** page in the browser, you should see your
changes rendered on the screen. A screenshot is provided at the bottom of the
page to show your target solution. Note that there may be differences in overall
size and position of the boxes depending on your browser and screen size.
